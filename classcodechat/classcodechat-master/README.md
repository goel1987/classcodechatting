I felt like I did ok. I did not understand how to do everything but spent awhile trying to learn it and feel like I understand it. I felt I should have started it sooner and could have done it better. I felt as if initally I got intimidated with some of the projects but I feel more at ease. I spent more time practicing and going over things.
